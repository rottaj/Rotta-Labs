# UT Cybersecurity Bootcamp Project
<p>This project was developed as part of the UT Cybersecurity Bootcamp to demonstrate security and best practices in deploying web applications. The project is hosted on Azure as a virtual machine and uses NextJS, Ethers Js, and Rive.app for animations.</p>

## About the Project
<p>The goal of this project is to create a web application that allows users to interact with Ethereum blockchain using Ethers.js library. The application uses NextJS, a popular React framework for building server-side rendered applications, and Rive.app for creating interactive animations.</p>
